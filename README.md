Sorting Algorithms

*** Bubble sort ****
~ simplest sorting algorithms
~ Repeatedly swaps the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
~ O(n^2)
~ 0(n)

*** Insertion sort ***
~ simple sorting algorithm
~ Iteratively inserts each element of an unsorted list into its correct position
~ O(n^2)
~ 0(n)
